          How Long Tasks Are Handled
        </h2>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          Currently, the application processes tasks synchronously. This means
          that while one task is running, no other actions can be performed.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          For example, while scraping data, you wonâ€™t be able to navigate to
          other components or perform other operations until the task is
          completed.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          This approach ensures that each task is executed fully without
          interruptions. Tasks may take several minutes, so please be patient.
        </p>
