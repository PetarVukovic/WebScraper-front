          <p className="text-gray-700 mt-2">
            Each search term is scraped separately for the whole area. Thus 10
            search terms will take 10 times as long as a single search term. Use
            only a smaller count of non-overlapping search terms to optimize the
            scraping process. A big list of very similar search terms will
            increase the runtime without providing much additional data.
            Description:{" "}
            <strong>
              Type what you want to search for as you would write it into the
              Google Maps search bar, e.g. restaurant or pet shelter.
            </strong>
            <b>
              {" "}
              The search terms should be unique because each requires the same
              processing time. Using similar terms is less efficient because of
              overlap but can slightly increase the capture rate (e.g. bar vs
              restaurant vs cafe). Putting location directly into search terms,
              e.g. restaurant Pittsburgh, is not recommended because you will
              only get max 120 results per search (Google's scrolling limit on a
              single search) but it can be done for speed.
            </b>{" "}
            You can also use direct place IDs here in the format
            place_id:ChIJ8_JBApXMDUcRDzXcYUPTGUY.
